            <p>WWe are a bunch of teens that learnt about the census's (censi?) from the late 2000s/early 2010s, in which thousands of people identified under the religion "Jedi", <br> and thought it would be funy if we made our own religion. We live by the way of the Grey Jedi. <br> We walk the thin line between the dark and the light, and believe that there should be balance between the two. <br> Violence is an option, but death is not. </p>
